# Changelog

## 0.3.1

- Add opportunistic WebRTC DataChannel transport between each paired phone and desktop.
- Keep the encrypted WSS Relay connected for signaling, presence, offline delivery and fallback.
- Encrypt SDP, ICE candidates and delayed acknowledgements inside the existing device envelope.
- Fall back to Relay after five seconds or immediately when a direct channel drops, preserving
  envelope IDs and exactly-once command semantics.
- Chunk direct encrypted envelopes with SHA-256 verification and DataChannel backpressure control.
- Bundle the native desktop WebRTC runtime and add a self-hosted STUN-only Coturn service.

Claude session ownership, Agent SDK runtime, history, approvals, model and effort behavior remain unchanged.
